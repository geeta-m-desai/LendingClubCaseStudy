## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
    - Identify the risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
    - Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
- What is the background of your project?
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
    - Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss).  
    - In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders.
     -We need to figure out the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 

- What is the dataset that is being used?
    - Loans data set is used
